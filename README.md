## Javascript DOM manipulation
A project realized as part of the "Complete JavaScript Course" of Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy.          
Design adapted for my liking.

### Game Rules:
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds    

- In each turn, a player rolls two dice as many times as he wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score    

- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn    

- OR, if the player rolls two 6 in a row, he looses his entire GLOBAL score . After that, it's the next player's turn   

- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn        

- The first player to reach 100 points (default) or a chosen winning score on GLOBAL score wins the game
